# Note for designing data intensive application

## Fundations of Data System 

### Ch02: Data model 

Relational Versus Document Databases
  
Take SCTE as example:

- They store the test data using Azure table which is document based model.
- It is advantage for its flexibility: easy add attributes.
- Its disadvantage is can not tracking the responsibilities of the data (generated by whose workload )
  - Document based model lack the power of many to many relationship support.
- So, if SCTE becomes to track many-to-many relationshipts, then maybe relational model is more useful.
- In current situation, the document based model is better choice for SCTE.


### Ch03: Storage and Retrieval

- Index, usually is built with B-tree.

### Ch04: Encoding and Evolution

- Encode and decode, protocol design and example 
- Data flow: 
  - RPC vs message passing: message passing is usually one-way, async.
  - Message broker: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka


## Distributed Data 

### Ch05: Replication
